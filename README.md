#Unbabel Frontend Challenge

This is my solution for the proposed exercise. I finished it using React, as it is my framework of choise, but I've a branch with a Vue based solution.

I used React-Boilerplate as a way to streamline the initial boilerplating setup, but also because I do appreciate the work done by those guys - it's realy a production ready solution.

wip!

## Commands

Install all dependencies:
```Shell
npm i
```

Start the development server running on `http://localhost:3000`
```Shell
npm run start
```

Start the production server
```Shell
npm run start:production
```

Preps your app for deployment (does not run tests). Optimizes and minifies all files, piping them to the `build` folder.
```Shell
npm run build
```

Tests your application with the unit tests specified in the `**/tests/*.js` files
throughout the application.  
Testing
```Shell
npm run test
```

The app is built for optimal performance: assets are
minified and served gzipped.
