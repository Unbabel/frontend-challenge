#Unbabel Frontend Challenge

This is my solution for the proposed exercise. I finished it using Vue, as it is my framework of choise, but I've a branch with a React based solution.

I used VueCli as a way to streamline the initial boilerplating setup.

## Commands

Install all dependencies:
```Shell
yarn
```

Start the development server running on `http://localhost:8080`
```Shell
yarn serve
```

Preps your app for deployment (does not run tests). Optimizes and minifies all files, piping them to the `dist` folder.
```Shell
yarn build
```

The app is built for optimal performance: assets are
minified and served gzipped.
